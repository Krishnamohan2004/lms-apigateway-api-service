# API Gateway - Online Learning Platform

## Purpose

Centralized API Gateway for the Online Learning Platform microservices ecosystem. This service acts as the single entry point for all client requests, handling JWT-based authentication, request routing, load balancing, and circuit-breaking across downstream services.

## Architecture Summary

```
Client --> [API Gateway :8080] --> Eureka Discovery --> Downstream Services
                |
         JWT Auth Filter
         (Global Filter)
```

The gateway is built on Spring Cloud Gateway (reactive/WebFlux) and integrates with Netflix Eureka for service discovery. All protected routes require a valid JWT Bearer token; authenticated user context is propagated downstream via custom headers.

## Build, Test, Run

```bash
# Build
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Run tests
./mvnw test

# Run locally
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Run JAR directly
java -jar target/api-gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Configuration

| Property | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `server.port` | Gateway listen port | 8080 |
| `jwt.secret` | HMAC signing key (hex-encoded) | See `application.yml` |
| `eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone` | Eureka server URL | `http://localhost:8761/eureka/` |

Configuration is managed via `src/main/resources/application.yml`. Environment-specific overrides can be applied through Spring profiles or environment variables.

## API Access

All downstream APIs are accessed through the gateway at `http://localhost:8080`. Routes are defined in `application.yml` under `spring.cloud.gateway.routes`. Public endpoints (no auth required):

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/courses/public/**`
- `POST /api/webhooks/payment`

All other endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
